node-finder.  It finds nodes.

You **must** replace WORLDPATH at the top of node-finder.py with the correct path to your level.  Haven't gotten around to implementing command-line options yet.

Pymclevel requires YAML and Numpy installed, so this does too.  Consult the project pages of each for installation instructions.

Written in Python 2.7 but as far as I know it should work on anything close.  I don't believe pymclevel relies on any funky behaviour.
